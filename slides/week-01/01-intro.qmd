## Course outline 

This is a new advanced course that is being developed during this term. 

- [Syllabus](../../syllabus.qmd)
- [Schedule](../../schedule.qmd)
- etc.

are all made available and constantly updated on

## Objectives {.smaller}

By the end of the semester, you will be made familiar with ...

-   Basics of Geological Carbon Storage
-   Techniques on how to monitor Geological Carbon Storage
-   How to scale up this net-negative carbon emission technology

For a motivational talk watch this [video by Philip Ringrose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eozVdrvejDs).
